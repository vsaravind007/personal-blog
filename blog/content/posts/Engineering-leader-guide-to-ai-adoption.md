Everyone wants to say “AI” in their marketing material now, suddenly every company is “AI powered” and we are at a point where people take notice if they don’t see “AI” in a product or even service offering. Whether you are on the side that believes AI is a bubble or on the side that thinks AI is the best thing since the internet, AI & AI assissted engineering are here to stay.

If you or your team are falling behind on developing AI as a skill, You will find it hard to compete with the millions who already have it in their workflow. It is not an option now, its a basic skill, even when seasoned developers dismiss AI as a toy or companies sit on the fence waiting for a miracle or a bubble burst, AI assissted engineering is fast moving forward - with or without you!

If you are an engineering leader trying to navigate the AI implementation maze and not sure where to start, below are a set of points you can use to get the ball rolling. These could be grouped into 3:

1. Planning
2. Pilot
3. Rollout

Before going through these pointers, understand the core first: 

>AI is not a magic bullet, nor it can magically replace your engineers overnight, but its a tool. A tool powerful enough to help developers with right skills to elevate themselves, QA engineers to go beyond conventional methods and PMs to get better at what they do. AI can help positively, *ONLY* if your foundation is strong, otherwise your AI adoption story will look like one of those Lovable disasters, maybe at different scale!


## 1. Planning

#### a. Start With Small Initiatives
Don’t start off with huge initiatives, start with small, low impact targets especially if your team isn’t huge, if things go wrong, you must be able to quickly deploy firefighters to handle the wrong doings - remember, the show must go on!

#### b. Identify An Interest Group
Lets be real, if you run a high performing engineering team, even if they’re strongly opinionated against AI, there will be people who are familiar with AI & tool usage, identify them & use their “out of job” skills for a greater cause.

#### c. Identify What You Want To Achieve With “AI Adoption”
This is critical, having no clarity on what you want to do will not be good, identify your cause - Improve developer productivity? Faster POCs ? Unit tests? Easy example would be developer productivity where you can set an expectation saying “Adopting AI into the workflow will improve the developer productivity by 20%” which translates to “all effort estimates from the dev team should now be 20% less”, realistically this can be anywhere from 10 to 30% depending on the adoption & your technology stack.

#### d. Create A Policy - Define Your IP
What defines “your tech, your IP”? Definitely a landing page isn’t your IP nor a simple css theme on Material UI or AntD. IP boundary is necessary because we don’t want to automate the DNA of your tech culture, you don’t want to replace people from your team, you’re trying to empower them, give them superhuman like abilities to do more in less time - time saved could be used for clearing tech debts or innovating.

#### e. Accept The Fact That There Will Be Significant CapEx Involved
AI tools are not cheap, people's time is not cheap and if your team is small, it will be quite expensive to handle mistakes. Running a pilot AI initiative will definitely come at a cost, but will lay the groundwork for the AI adoption within the organisation.

## 2. Pilot

#### a. Identify A Pilot
Running a pilot project to test the capabilities and fitment is extremely important. It is also required to make informed decisions and  will help identifying the extend at which you can utilise the findings across other projects. It is easier to get started with frontend applications, especially web applications - AI coding assistants seem to work very well for UI building and web frontend implementations.

#### b. Procure An AI Tool
There are a lot of dedicated AI first dev tools and IDE extensions that allow developers to leverage AI into their workflows. When it comes to full blown AI tools, Cursor and Windsurf are the most popular ones, but when it comes to IDE extensions - Cline, Roo Code and Continue.dev are the top choices. Whatever the tool, the underlying LLM is responsible for the actual code and Anthropic Sonet models & Qwen3-Coder LLMs perform the best. Procuring an AI tool is a task on its own, to begin with - start with Cursor or Windsurf or even Github Co-Pilot, to kick-off this initiative, you need an AI tool.

#### c. Give Access To Senior Members
“Senior members” are the high skilled ones in your team who will be able to identify the difference between good code and garbage code, basically people who can categorise a piece of code into one of these -  “it works, but not the best solution”, “it works, but it shouldn’t”, “this is good”. This group should be the ones that gets things done in your team, they will be able to judge the abilities and limitations pretty quickly within your development context.

#### d. Get the AI Working Group To Assess The Tool Quantitatively.
But first, it is important to make them understand that it is not for replacing people, but for empowering & improving the workforce. Get this group to assess the impact of AI with simple metrics, for example - “out of 10 debugging sessions with AI, 6 of them were successful” or “LLM was able to identify the root cause & provide potential fixes from the error logs in 5 out of 5 instances”

## 3. Rollout
This is where you would start rolling out AI as a capabilitiy or a developer aid while thinking about some of the following points

#### a. Decide How You Want To Make The Tools Available
Are you going to self host the LLM or use a cloud based offering? If you have the abilty to host LLMs in your on infrastructure, its the best because you own the entire value chain & can be at peace knowing your code remains within your control, its also better from compliance perspective. However, it also means that you have to make sure the uptime & availability once it is part of the workflow. Not all companies will have the ability to self host LLMs and most of the times, it won’t scale well.

#### b. Revise The Policies
Once you have your findings from your pilot, you can review the outcomes and review the policies you defined in section 1.d. It is possible that your policy can be a limiting factor in extracting the full potential of AI assissted development. Review your policy and make changes if necessary before the actual rollout.

#### c. Update The Dev Workflow
Once you have the policies and tools ready, you can update your developer workflow to include AI assistance. You can encourage your developers to adopt AI in their work through training, KT sessions or hackathons. Remember the fact that developers are generally opiniated - which sometimes means that you have to show the benefits before they even think about using it. 

#### d. Adjust KPIs
Once AI is in your developer workflow, you should be able to clearly differentiate between "Before AI" and "After AI" through numbers and metrics. You should also revise your the performance KPIs accordingly to include the AI assistance. The idea is that you should be able to offset the CapEx on AI tools and initiatives through developer productivity or faster turn around times.

## Closing Thoughts
Personally, being part of a few AI adoption initiatives at SME scale and using AI assistance in my own development workflows, the points above oftem present themselves in different forms, having concrete plans and answers around these defines your success rate. Whether you are in the hype train, or in denial, AI tools and AI assisted tools are here to stay. All of the major players - Meta, Google, OpenAI, Alibaba and Anthropic are now focusing on smaller, less resource intensive LLMs which means AI tools are going to be there everywhere, AI assisted workflows are already becoming common, expect it to be an expectation!
